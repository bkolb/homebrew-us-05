### Working with OpenSSH _from this repo_

When upgrading or install OpenSSH from this repo, a few files will need to have their permissions changed.

```shell
cd /usr/local/etc/ssh
sudo chown root:wheel *_key
sudo chmod 600 *_key
```

#### TODOs

- [ ] change permissions, owner, and group of above mentioned files when installing formula.

> If LibreSSL has been updated from mainline Homebrew, ie. upgrading from v2.7.x to v2.8.x then this version of OpenSSH will need to be reinstalled from this tap.
